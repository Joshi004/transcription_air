# üéØ Next Steps to Complete Setup

## ‚úÖ What's Done

1. ‚úÖ Project structure created
2. ‚úÖ Docker containers built successfully
3. ‚úÖ Environment configured with your HF_TOKEN
4. ‚úÖ Backend and Frontend code implemented
5. ‚úÖ All dependencies fixed (NumPy compatibility)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue

The backend crashes when trying to download models inside Docker due to memory constraints. **Solution**: Download models to your host machine first, then mount them into the container.

---

## üì• Step 1: Download Models to Host Machine

You have two options:

### Option A: Using the provided script (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/nareshjoshi/Documents/TetherWorkspace/TranscriptionService

# Install Python dependencies on your Mac (if not already installed)
pip3 install openai-whisper pyannote.audio torch torchaudio

# Set your HF token
export HF_TOKEN=actual_token

# Run the download script
python3 download_models.py
```

**This will:**
- Download Whisper Large v3 (~3GB) to `./models/whisper/`
- Download Pyannote 3.1 (~500MB) to `./models/pyannote/`
- Take 10-15 minutes depending on your internet speed

### Option B: Manual download (if script fails)

```bash
# Create models directories
mkdir -p models/whisper models/pyannote

# Download Whisper
python3 -c "import whisper; whisper.load_model('large-v3', download_root='./models/whisper')"

# For Pyannote, it will download on first container start
```

---

## üöÄ Step 2: Start the Services

Once models are downloaded:

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Monitor logs (wait 30-60 seconds for initialization)
docker-compose logs -f backend

# You should see:
# "Models loaded successfully!"
# "Running on http://0.0.0.0:5501"
```

---

## üåê Step 3: Access the Application

Open your browser:

**Frontend UI:**
```
http://localhost:3501
```

**Backend API:**
```
http://localhost:5501/api/health
```

---

## üß™ Step 4: Test the System

### Quick Test

1. **Check Backend Health**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5501/api/health
   ```
   Should return: `{"status": "healthy", "models_loaded": true}`

2. **View Audio Files**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5501/api/audio-files
   ```
   Should show your `mentlist.mp3` file

3. **Open Frontend**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3501`
   - You should see your audio file listed
   - Click "Transcribe" to start processing

### First Transcription

**Note**: First transcription will take 20-35 minutes for a 30-minute audio file on CPU.

1. Click "Transcribe" button on `mentlist.mp3`
2. UI will poll status every 5 seconds
3. Wait for completion (you can close browser and come back)
4. Once complete, click "View & Play"
5. Enjoy synchronized audio playback with transcript!

## üìä System Requirements Check

Before downloading models, ensure you have:

- ‚úÖ **Disk Space**: ~5GB free (for models)
- ‚úÖ **RAM**: 24GB (you have this!)
- ‚úÖ **Internet**: Stable connection for ~4GB download
- ‚úÖ **Docker**: Running and healthy

Check Docker:
```bash
docker ps
docker system info | grep Memory
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Models not downloading

**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify HF_TOKEN is set
echo $HF_TOKEN

# Accept Pyannote license (required!)
# Visit: https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1
# Click "Agree and access repository"

# Try download again
python3 download_models.py
```

### Issue: Backend still crashing

**Check logs**:
```bash
docker-compose logs backend | tail -50
```

**Common causes**:
- Models not in `./models/` directory
- HF_TOKEN not set correctly in `.env`
- Pyannote license not accepted

### Issue: Frontend can't connect to backend

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if backend is running
docker-compose ps

# Check backend health
curl http://localhost:5501/api/health

# Restart services
docker-compose restart
```

### Issue: Port already in use

**Solution**:
```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :5501
lsof -i :3501

# Kill the process or change ports in docker-compose.yml
```

---

## üìù Expected Timeline

1. **Model Download**: 10-15 minutes (one-time)
2. **Docker Startup**: 30-60 seconds
3. **Model Loading**: 2-3 minutes (in Docker)
4. **First Transcription**: 20-35 minutes (for 30-min audio)

**Total time to first transcript**: ~40-50 minutes

---

## üí° Tips

1. **Start with a short test file** (2-3 minutes) to verify the pipeline works before processing your 30-minute audio
2. **Monitor Docker memory** with `docker stats` during processing
3. **Keep terminal open** to see logs during first run
4. **Save transcripts** - they're in `./transcripts/` directory as JSON files

---

## üéì What to Do After First Success

Once your first transcription works:

1. **Test synchronized playback** - Click any transcript segment to jump to that point
2. **Try different audio files** - Add more files to `./Audio/` directory
3. **Check transcript quality** - Review speaker labels and accuracy
4. **Plan for scale** - Consider GPU server for faster processing (10x speedup!)

## üéâ Summary

**Current Status**: Everything is built and ready!

**What You Need To Do**:
1. Download models to host machine (10-15 min)
2. Start Docker services
3. Open http://localhost:3501
4. Click "Transcribe" and wait (20-35 min)

**You're almost there!** üöÄ
