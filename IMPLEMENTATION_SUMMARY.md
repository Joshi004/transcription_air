- ✅ Inline code comments

## 🚀 What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Get Your Hugging Face Token

1. Go to [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
2. Create a new token (Read access is sufficient)
3. Copy the token (starts with `hf_`)

### Step 2: Accept Pyannote License

1. Visit [https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1)
2. Click "Agree and access repository"

### Step 3: Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Copy the template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit and add your token
nano .env
```

Add your token:
```env
HF_TOKEN=hf_your_actual_token_here
```

### Step 4: Run Setup (Easy Way)

Use the automated setup script:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

This will:
- Check your .env configuration
- Create necessary directories
- Optionally download models
- Build Docker containers

### Step 5: Start the Service

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up

# Or run in background
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 6: Access the Application

Open your browser to:
```
http://localhost:3501
```

Backend API:
```
http://localhost:5501
```

## 🎯 How to Use

### First Transcription

1. **View Files**: The UI shows all audio files from `Audio/` directory
2. **Start Transcription**: Click "Transcribe" button
3. **Wait**: Processing takes ~20-35 minutes for 30-min audio on CPU
4. **Monitor**: UI polls status every 5 seconds
5. **View Result**: Click "View & Play" when complete

### Synchronized Playback

Once transcription is complete:
- Play audio with standard controls
- Watch transcript auto-highlight as audio plays
- Click any transcript segment to jump to that timestamp
- See speaker labels with color coding
- Auto-scroll keeps current segment visible

### Transcript Files

Transcripts are saved in `transcripts/` as JSON:

```json
{
  "filename": "mentlist.mp3",
  "duration": 1800.5,
  "language": "en",
  "status": "completed",
  "processing_time": 1245.6,
  "segments": [
    {
      "start": 0.0,
      "end": 2.5,
      "speaker": "SPEAKER_00",
      "text": "Hello, how are you?"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🎨 Key Design Decisions

### Why Models on Host?

✅ **Benefits:**
- Share models across multiple containers
- No need to rebuild Docker when updating models
- Smaller Docker images (~2GB vs ~10GB)
- Easy to switch between model versions
- Can toggle to remote API without code changes

### Why Full Sequential Processing?

✅ **Benefits:**
- Best accuracy for transcription
- Best accuracy for speaker diarization
- Simpler implementation
- Easier to debug
- Perfect for batch processing

### Why These Ports?

- **3501** (frontend) - Avoids common conflicts (3000, 3001)
- **5501** (backend) - Avoids common conflicts (5000)
- Easy to change in docker-compose.yml if needed

## 📊 Expected Performance

### On Your MacBook Pro (24GB RAM, CPU):

- **30-min audio file:**
  - Whisper: 15-25 minutes
  - Pyannote: 5-10 minutes
  - **Total: ~20-35 minutes**

- **Memory usage:** 12-15GB peak during processing
- **CPU usage:** High (fan will run)
- **Disk space:** ~4GB for models

### Future with GPU Server:

- **30-min audio: 3-5 minutes** (10x faster!)
- Same code, just change MODEL_MODE or host

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

Before using for real work:

- [ ] Backend health check: `curl http://localhost:5501/api/health`
- [ ] Frontend accessible: `http://localhost:3501`
- [ ] Audio files visible in UI
- [ ] Can click "Transcribe" without errors
- [ ] Status updates every 5 seconds during processing
- [ ] Transcript appears when complete
- [ ] Audio player works
- [ ] Transcript highlights during playback
- [ ] Click-to-seek works

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work, check:

1. **Docker is running**: `docker ps`
2. **Ports are free**: `lsof -i :5501` and `lsof -i :3501`
3. **HF_TOKEN is set**: `cat .env | grep HF_TOKEN`
4. **Logs**: `docker-compose logs backend` and `docker-compose logs frontend`
5. **Models downloaded**: `ls -la models/whisper/ models/pyannote/`

See README.md for detailed troubleshooting.

## 🎓 Next Steps After Testing

### Enhancements You Can Add:

1. **File Upload**: Add POST endpoint to upload audio files
2. **Speaker Naming**: Rename SPEAKER_00 to actual names
3. **Export Formats**: SRT, VTT, TXT exports
4. **Progress Bar**: Show percentage during processing
5. **Batch Queue**: Process multiple files in sequence
6. **Remote Models**: Integrate with cloud GPU APIs

### Migration to GPU Server:

When ready to scale:

1. Set up GPU server with Docker
2. Update `.env`: `MODEL_MODE=local` (models on GPU server)
3. Or: `MODEL_MODE=remote` with API endpoint
4. Deploy with same docker-compose
5. Enjoy 10x faster processing!
